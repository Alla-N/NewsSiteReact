        <figcaption>Time management skills will make working exponentially easier.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>The best things in life may be free, but that doesn't mean they won't take time, sweat, and perseverance to acquire.</p>
    <p>That's especially the case when it comes to learning important life skills.</p>
    <p>In an effort to ascertain which talents are worth the investment, one Quota reader posed the question: What are the hardest and most useful skills to learn?</p>
    <p>We've highlighted our favorite takeaways.</p>
    <h2>1. Time management</h2>
    <p>Effective time management is one of the most highly valued skills by employers. While there is no one right way, it's important to find a system that works for you and stick to it, Alina Grzegorzewska explains.</p>
    <p>"The hardest thing to learn for me was how to plan," she writes. "Not to execute what I have planned, but to make so epic a to-do list and to schedule it so thoroughly that I'm really capable of completing all the tasks on the scheduled date."</p>   
    <h2>2. Empathy</h2>    
    <p>"You can be the most disciplined, brilliant, and even wealthy individual in the world, but if you don't care for or empathize with other people, then you are basically nothing but a sociopath," writes Kamia Taylor.</p>    
    <p>Empathy, as business owner Jane Woodward explains, is a fundamental human ability that has too readily been forsworn by modern business.</p>   
    <p>"Empathy — the ability to feel what others feel — is what makes good sales and service people truly great. Empathy as in team spirit — esprit d'corps — motivates people to try harder. Empathy drives employees to push beyond their own apathy, to go bigger, because they feel something bigger than just a paycheck," she writes.</p>   
    <h2>3. Mastering your sleep</h2>    
    <p>There are so many prescribed sleep hacks out there it's often hard to keep track. But regardless of what you choose, establishing a ritual can help ensure you have restful nights.</p>
    <p>Numerous studies show that being consistent with your sleep schedule makes it easier to fall asleep and wake up, and it helps promote better sleep in general.</p>

    </figure>
    <h2>4. Positive self-talk</h2>
    <p>"Ultimately it doesn't matter what others think of you," writes Shobhit Singhal, "but what you think of yourself certainly does, and it takes time to build that level of confidence and ability to believe in yourself when nobody else does."</p>
    <p>On the other side of positive self-talk is negative self-talk, which Betsy Myers, founding director of The Center for Women and Business at Bentley University, believes can slowly chip away at your confidence.</p>
    <h2>5. Consistency</h2>
    <p>Whether you're trying a new exercise routine, studying for the LSATs, or working on an important project, Khaleel Syed writes that consistency is vital to maintaining any kind of success.</p>
    <p>People often stop working hard when they reach the top, he explains, but to maintain that top position, they have to work harder and be more consistent in their work.</p>
    <h2>6. Asking for help</h2>
    <p>"I once was told in a job interview, 'You can't have this job if you can't ask for help when you need it,'" Louise Christy writes. "Naturally, I said I could. Later, I found out that the previous person with that job had screwed up big-time because he was in over his head but couldn't admit it and didn't ask for help."</p>
    <p>She explains that knowing when you need help and then asking for it is surprisingly difficult to learn and do because no one wants to be perceived as weak or incompetent.</p>
    <p>But a recent study from the Harvard Business School suggests doing so makes you look more, not less, capable. According to the study authors, when you ask people for advice, you validate their intelligence or expertise, which makes you more likely to win them over.</p>
    <h2>7. Knowing when to shut up — and actually doing it</h2>
    <p>"You can't go around whining about every other thing that seems not-so-right to you in this world," writes Roshna Nazir. "Sometimes you just need to shut up."</p>
    <p>There are many instances when keeping to yourself is the best course. "When we are angry, upset, agitated, or vexed," writes Anwesha Jana, "we blurt out anything and everything that comes to our mind." And later, you tend to regret it.</p>
    <p>Keeping your mouth shut when you're agitated is one of the most valuable skills to learn, and of course, one of the most difficult.</p>

        <figcaption>The first step to listening: stop talking.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>8. Listening</h2>
    <p>Along with shutting up comes listening, says Richard Careaga.</p>
    <p>"Most of us in the workplace are so overwhelmed with things to do — instant messaging, phones ringing. I mean, our brain can only tolerate so much information before it snaps," Nicole Lipkin, author of " What Keeps Leaders Up At Night," previously told Business Insider.</p>
    <p>One tip for active listening is repeating back what you heard to the other person. "It makes things so much easier when everyone is on the same page," she said.</p>
    <h2>9. Minding your business</h2>
    <p>"It takes ages to learn and master this," writes Aarushi Ruddra.</p>
    <p>Sticking your nose into other people's work isn't helpful and wastes time and resources, she says. "You have no right to put forth your two or four cents, even if you are the last righteous person standing."</p>
    <h2>10. Mastering your thoughts</h2>
    <p>To do what you want to do and accomplish what you want to accomplish, you need to consciously direct your thinking, writes Mark Givert.</p>
    <p>"The challenge is that we are the product of our past experience and all of our thinking is the result of this," he says. "However, the past does not equal the future."</p>

    <h1>5 Lessons Most People Learn Way Too Late in Life</h1>
    <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news2-1.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption>The first step to listening: stop talking.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>"What are the lessons people most often learn too late in life?" 
    originally appeared on Quora--the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people 
    to learn from others and better understand the world.</p>
    <p>Answer by Alyssa Satara, co-founder at Refugee Code Academy, on Quora:</p>
    <h2>1. Perception is reality</h2>
    <p>It's true. The way you interpret and understand the world directly affects your 
    beliefs and the way you live your life. Perception creates bias as much as it creates 
    understanding. It creates fear as much as it creates curiosity.</p>
    <p>Do you want your reality to be narrow or vast?</p>
    <p>Will the bliss that ignorance provides be sufficient, or do you need more?</p>
    <p>The truth is most people want more. Even if it is on a subconscious level. 
    Humans tend to trail blaze. From cradle to the grave, our society emphasizes the 
    importance of education. Learning and discovering is what we do, but still it is 
    increasingly hard to understand what you don't understand.</p>
    <p>So how do you learn to know what you don't know? Start by asking yourself:
     What don't I know? What do you want to learn more about?</p>
     <p>Most importantly, understand that it's OK to be wrong. In error there is growth.</p>
     <h2>2. Everything is temporary</h2>
     <p>Your good times are temporary and your bad times are temporary. 
     So when you're up, enjoy it, bask in it, and be grateful for it. 
     And when you're down, know you will get through it. Know that it's not the end, 
     and that it's just a rough patch. Life is full of twists and turns, ups and downs, 
     and surprises.</p>
     <p>We forget that it's about the journey not the destination.</p>
     <p>There is a lesson in everything. I think it's hard for a lot of people--especially 
     young people--to appreciate life. Recognizing the full worth of your hardships and 
     your blunders is key to appreciating the journey. It's just as important to stay humble 
     and be grateful for the joys life brings you.</p>
     <p>Everything is temporary, so make the most out of all of it.</p>
    <h2>3. The importance of being present</h2>
    <p>"If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are 
    living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present." --Lao Tzu</p>
    <p>More often than not, we tend to worry about what's to come, or dwell on 
    something that's already happened. While it's crucial to care and consider your 
    future, be careful not to let it hinder your present. Moments turn into memories. 
    Enjoy the moment while you have it.</p>
    <p>It usually takes a lifetime of piled up worries for a person to realize: 
    Worrying isn't productive.</p>
    <p>Living in the past is equally unproductive. There are definitely benefits in 
    being able to reflect on yourself and on your past. Paying attention to what you've 
    been through and how that makes you feel matters. It takes a lot of emotional energy 
    to grieve, process, and overcome.</p>
    <p>The balance of being able to take time to reflect, and to prioritize your future 
    while spending the majority of your day in the present, is beyond valuable, it's life 
    changing.</p>
    <h2>4. Do what you love, love what you do</h2>
    <p>There was a huge mosaic near my university in London that said that those words. 
    I was grateful to walk past it almost every day and remind myself of the importance of 
    loving your career and loving what you do. Your work is a considerably large aspect in 
    your life that you dedicate yourself to. If you aren't happy in your career, that 
    unhappiness will seep into other aspects of your life. And while nothing is perfect, 
    it's important to work on yourself and position yourself to reach the goals and 
    satisfactions you desire.</p>
    <p>Most importantly: Invest in yourself.</p>
    <p>This goes for your non-work life, too. What habits and hobbies do you want to stop? 
    Which ones do you want to develop? It's important to be conscious of the type of people 
    and activities you surround yourself with. Information is like nutrients to your brain, 
    be aware of what you are feeding yourself. Success isn't one triumphant moment. Success 
    is a series of moments (and choices) leading up to bigger moments.</p>
    <p>You are the only person who can get in the way of living every day doing what you love.</p>
    <p>Bob Dylan said it best when he said "What's money? A man is a success if he gets 
    up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do."</p>
    <h2>5. Being happy takes work</h2>
    <p>The happiest people tend to be the ones who've worked the most on themselves. 
    Being happy takes a lot of work. It's just as much work--if not more-- to be unhappy. 
    So choose wisely. Being happy means at some point you decided to take control of your life.
     It means you decided to not be a victim and to put that energy back into yourself. 
     Sometimes it's hard, but you have to pull yourself up and push yourself forward.</p>
     <p>Your lifetime is a series of developments and personal growth.</p>
     <p>One of the worst things you can do for self-development is comparing yourself 
     to other people. It's easy to get caught up in jealousy and wanting what other people 
     have. Especially with the way we interact with social media. You have to remember that 
     people tend to show only the best parts of their lives on those platforms. It's not fair 
     to yourself when you see that and think "I want to do that" or "I want to look like that". 
     Not only does that distract you from being appreciative of what you have in our own life, 
     it doesn't provide any productive input to yourself. Most often, your perception of 
     someone's life is a fallacy. And even if it isn't, focus on yourself. It's your journey 
     and your path that you should be concerned with.</p>
     <p>Being happy takes practice. Whether it's you learning to 
     let go of your ego, or forming more self-loving habits...it takes practice. 
     You only have one life, work as hard as you can to make it your best life.</p>

    <h1>20 Habits of Happy People You Should Adopt in 2019</h1>
    <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news3-1.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>1. Forgive more.</h2>
    <p>The Buddha once said:</p>
    <p>Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the 
    intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.</p>
    <p>Remember everyone is fighting their own battle, and everyone 
    is trying their best. Learn to forgive other people and set yourself free.</p>
    <h2>2. Meditate daily.</h2>
    <p>Meditation is a beautiful way to still your mind – giving you a break 
    from circling thoughts, worries and anxieties. Start with two minutes a day 
    and build your way up to longer sittings.</p>
    <h2>3. See the world as awe-inspiring.</h2>
    <p>Imagine if you woke up this morning and saw the world around you for 
    the first time. You would be absolutely amazed, fascinated and excited. 
    Start seeing the world through fresh eyes and notice all the magic and 
    beauty you may be missing.</p>
    <h2>4. Let go of things you can’t control.</h2>
    <p>When the bus is late, the queue is long or the café runs out of your 
    favorite salad, take a deep breath and let it wash over you like water off a 
    duck’s back. Don’t allow external events to steal your inner peace and joy. 
    Master the art of letting go.</p>
    <h2>5. Experience the flow of things you love.</h2>
    <p>When you’re completely focused on doing something you truly love, 
    you lose your sense of ego and time. It may be through dancing, cooking, 
    writing, running, building, painting or something unique to you. Make this 
    experience of “flow” a part of your weekly schedule.</p>
    <h2>6. Be more present.</h2>  
    <p>When you worry about things going wrong in advance of them happening, 
    you’re creating your own private hell in an otherwise peaceful and beautiful 
    present moment.</p>  
    <p>Try bringing yourself back to the present moment throughout the day by 
    noticing the sense of your body in your chair, the touch of the fabric against 
    your skin or the gentle sensation of air on your face.</p>
    <h2>7. Spend time in nature.</h2>
    <p>Nature can have a calming effect and reminds us to slow down, take 
    deep breaths and soak up the present moment. So make time for more bush walks, 
    beach trips, picnics in the park and reading by the river.</p>
    <h2>8. Take up yoga.</h2>
    <p>Yoga is a beautiful way to align your body and soul – this in turn 
    can increase your sense of wholeness and inner peace. It’s also the kind 
    of exercise you can do anywhere, without equipment, once you’ve learned a few 
    simple moves.</p>
    <h2>9. Spend time alone with yourself.</h2>
    <p>You need time alone to catch up on updates from the person you really 
    need to stay in touch with – yourself. Spend time alone unpacking your worries 
    and anxieties, and getting back in touch with your deepest desires and dreams. 
    Schedule weekly or monthly solo dates in your yearly planner.</p>
    <h2>10. Keep an inspiration file.</h2>
    <p>Some days, you wake up feeling incredibly motivated and inspired to 
    achieve your dreams. Other days, you wake up and the motivation has completely 
    vanished.</p>
    <p>That’s why it’s so useful to keep an inspiration file filled with your favorite 
    quotes, stories and words of wisdom when your soul needs a boost. You can use a 
    physical scrapbook or an album on your phone.</p>
    <h2>11. Practice gratitude.</h2>
    <p>There is a reason gratitude is being promoted everywhere lately – 
    it’s one of life’s sweet shortcuts to happiness. By focusing your attention on 
    all of the beautiful things and simple joys in life, you will notice and attract 
    more and more of them.</p>
    <h2>12. Give without strings attached.</h2>
    <p>Giving and receiving are one in truth. When you give to someone with no 
    strings attached – whether it be a physical gift, a compliment or your time – 
    you are nourished as well as the receiver.</p>
    <h2>13. Embrace uncertainty.</h2>
    <p>Uncertainty is a natural part of life and an inevitable factor in making big 
    life changes. Learn to embrace it, and know that you will always be okay at every 
    moment in your journey, even if you can’t quite see the road to the finish line yet.</p>
    <h2>14. Write a soul journal.</h2>
    <p>Writing a soul journal is a bit like keeping a traditional journal, except 
    that you ask your soul tough questions and seek guidance on things you’re struggling 
    with. The key is to write your stream-of-consciousness without self-censoring. 
    You may be amazed by the wisdom residing deep within you.</p>
    <h2>15. Replenish your well.</h2>
    <p>Life can feel so busy and fast-paced – before you know it, you’re running on 
    empty. You don’t serve the world by burning yourself out. Take breaks. Schedule a 
    day off for fun and laughter. Book a holiday. Don’t always cut short your lunch break.</p>
    <h2>16. Compare less.</h2>
    <p>Mark Twain once said, “Comparison is the death of joy”. Life would be pretty 
    boring if every restaurant was the same, every romantic partner was the same, or 
    every day was the same. Accept when things are not as you expected and appreciate 
    that it makes life interesting.</p>
    <h2>17. Make time for friendship.</h2>
    <p>One of the top five regrets of the dying is not spending enough time with friends. 
    Create a weekly or monthly ritual with your friends, like dinner at a local restaurant, 
    trivia night or morning yoga session.</p>
    <h2>18. Trust yourself.</h2>
    <p>So often we make mistakes and bad decisions in life because we’ve ignored the 
    inner voice of guidance inside of us. Trust your intuition. Your soul knows what is 
    right for you.</p>
    <h2>19. Commit to living a life true to you.</h2>
    <p>When you live, work, date, play, eat, drink, create, dance, travel and 
    dream in ways that feel right with your soul, you come alive, and the whole 
    world benefits.</p>
    <h2>20. Be gentle on yourself.</h2>
    <p>You are perfect and complete exactly as you are. Even when you are striving to 
    improve and grow, you are complete and worthy of self-love.</p>

        <p>Disclaimer : Everybody’s mind works differently. This is not a universal 
        guide, in any way, and should be treated as mere pondering of the writer.</p>
        <p>The monkey mind is not easy to fine-tune for the modern-day work requirements. 
        Essentially, minds similar to those of people 5000 years back are now working on 
        building businesses, space ships, saving people’s lives etc. Given how easy it is to 
        live a difficult life or worse screw it up badly, it helps to learn how to direct this
        monkey mind to tasks we deem necessary and important. We are obviously not optimised,
         as biological creatures, for working productively for 8hrs per day and more. I’ve come
          up with 3 requirements to build a lifestyle of high performance, considering the 
          utter ineffectiveness of our monkey minds. It’s insane how suboptimal and flawed our 
          minds are. We’re all doing so much cognition with our pre-frontal cortex everyday but 
          e weren’t even built for this. We were built for a whole other game of survival and 
          reproduction. Our starting point is so low. Fuck! We need to be very careful in 
          designing this lifestyle, building it one piece at a time, overcoming the obstacles 
          to success one at a time. I’ve personally had months or even years of struggle to 
          adjust to this and fall into a sufficiently productive daily routine. Still going 
          through hurdles and dealing with this mind everyday. You can’t escape it. The only 
          way out is to learn to edge it towards the most desired outcome. Anyway, let’s look 
          at these 3 things.</p>
          <h2>Step #1 : The WorkPlace</h2>
          <p>Be in an undistracted calm environment with all the necessary tools to work. 
          I personally prefer a library. It just does it for me. When I walk into a library, 
          I feel like a kid on christmas eve. “Oh my god. So much books to read, so many 
          educated people around, such silence and WiFi too!”</p>
          <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news4-2.jpeg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The right environment is a crucial factor in deciding your overall mood during work. It can make or break your productivity. Some people are blessed with a natural ability to ignore distractions and work anywhere. But not me and I’m guessing not you too(even if you think otherwise).</p>
        <p>Have you noticed that when you go to a temple, church or other religious places, you suddenly go to a calm and soothing state of mind? The effect of the environment on your mood is underrated. A friend of mine recently told me that there is a practice in yoga/spirituality of identifying, absorbing and releasing energy from a physical area. People go to one specific spot everyday and do meditation etc and that spot apparently holds those vibrations and energy. So when they go back to the same spot, they can quickly go back to vibrating with the same frequency — something along those lines. But the bottomline is : Find a good nourishing workplace.</p>
        <h2>Step #2 : The Routine</h2>
        <p>Make it a habit to come to the workplace no matter what. Even if you get bored the shit out of your head, do something to pass the time until the clock turns 8pm or whatever time you go home. If you’re bored, wander around, talk to people, brainstorm on ideas etc. The goal is to develop a habit out of delaying gratification and developing self-discipline. I call this going to the island, in reference to the movie Cast Away. The idea is that if you have nothing else to do, boredom will make you do the required work. Everything else becomes so boring that doing the work is the only interesting option left. After 3–4 days, you’ll develop the confidence that comes from having stuck to the routine. And this confidence leads to more inclination to follow the routine which leads to more time spent at the workplace which leads to more confidence….and so on and so forth. It becomes a positive self-feeding loop. Find the loop and trigger it.</p>
        <p>Once you start going to the workplace and initially feel uncomfortable with this new habit, you will most likely feel like going back to your safe-zone. This is natural and the reason is this : Endorphin release in the past for staying in your comfort zone have rewired your neural circuits and when you step out of your comfort zone, your brain(amygdala) associates fear & pain to the “new experiences”. This is an evolutionary conditioning we’ve picked up over the years. Check out my article on Crushing Your Comfort Zone.</p>
        <p>When this urge to fall back hits, I’ve come to train myself to see that Quitting is for Cowards. I personally had a negative self-loathing experience one day when I came back home from work because it was too tough — too many hard problems to solve and too less clarity. That single experience now fuels my drive to stay at work till night. “No matter what, I won’t run away from discomfort like that ever again.” That’s a past failure now fuelling my present and future work ethic. At that time, it felt horrible. But now I’m glad I had it. And that’s how negative experiences turn into positive ones. It’s just a natural part of growth and personality development. I’m not trying to sound cocky or dogmatic here. Just documenting my thoughts and experiences. So fuck off, haters :D</p>
        <h2>Step #3 : The Interest</h2>
        <p>You need two things to get shit done. Build momentum. And sustain momentum. If you follow step-2 properly, you develop the bedrock of all productivity — discipline. You now know that no matter what, you will go to the workplace and spend your time there. Without this, you cannot hope to have a long-term guarantee of success. When you know you can sustain momentum, your next goal is to spark the fire. To start the snowball. To generate enough interest for taking action. Here are some tips to do that.</p>
        <h3>Tip #1 : Don’t finish the task</h3>
        <p>Leave the workplace on a cliffhanger with a high-note. For example, if you’ve built all the individual components of your product and all that’s left is to integrate them to finish the product, don’t do it at the end of the day. Don’t get closure. Leave it there. Let the surprise tingle your brain in your dreams. This is how you keep the flame going. This is what gets you hooked and makes you come back. This is something I practiced while working at my job and also something I’ve recently found out from Tim Ferriss’s podcast. The brain works through associations. When you leave it unfinished on purpose, you feel mild anxiety, enthusiasm which are essentially the cousins of interest.</p>
        <h3>Tip #2 : Start small</h3>
        <p>Start with something small that is likely to be exciting. Take a pen/paper, draw and design stuff instead of plunging into hardcore problem-solving.

        Kindling that fire needs to be done carefully without distractions and external forces that may put out the fire before it’s even lit. Also, it’s important to figure out what motivates you specifically and then tweak accordingly. For example, something that motives me is adventure and the thrill of the new. So I ask myself “what is the new in this? what adventure can be had?”.</p>
        <h3>Tip #3 : Be part of a buzzing community</h3>
        <p>Talk to other people involved with your work, watch tutorials or youtube videos, go to meetups or other events. Collaborate with other experts on a project. If you’re isolated and have only your cat to talk to, you will not only miss out a lot but also find it tough to sustain long-term interest in a project. A senior of mine in college said, “Coding is fun. But it is 10X more fun if you do it with others.” The advantage of the community is that they will take you along the journey and make it much easy for you. They might not do your work but they will definitely help you spark the interest.</p>
        <h3>Tip #4 : Therapy Talks</h3>
        <p>I recently wrote an article on the importance of documentation. Talk to yourself, have that inner mental dialogue. Convincing yourself to drop the mental walls and flow. The mind erects walls when it doesn’t want to do something. Your job is to dig deep and find the reason behind this and solve it somehow. This is a very difficult thing to do. My mind is very rigid. Once the walls are erected, it takes me hours of self-talk and introspection to bring them down temporarily. This is possibly the most important step of the whole process(consider 80/20 analysis). If you can develop an insatiable interest in your work, nothing will stop you. This is why, in the book Think and Grow Rich, Desire is the first step to success. You can effectively develop enough interest to override discipline or lack of a proper workplace. You will be able to sit in a noisy room full of distractions, have 10 other things to do, have other things you need to take care of….and yet, if you’re deeply interested in your work, you will eventually swim toward it no matter how hard it is. I’m still working on my own way of developing this interest. And it is understandably hard. If you can develop interest at will, there is theoretically nothing stopping you from doing any kind of required work. You will be able to flow like water. Do what is necessary. We all can think and figure out what is necessary. But to actually get yourself to do what is necessary is, in my experience, really tough unless you have somehow developed a natural passion for the involved work (which also is not an optimal scenario because you can’t stay detached and put your focus on something that’s not your passion (unless you somehow have a natural passion for all the necessary areas of work which is very unlikely)).</p>
        <p>This whole process of developing interest is filled with lots of self-doubt, frustration and hopelessness. It deserves it’s own book or a couple of books. The reason it’s necessary for developing a work ethic is that discipline will only take you to the gates. To go inside and do the magic, you need interest. No amount of discipline can make you solve hard problems that require a lot of brainpower. It’s just not possible to sway your mind like that.</p>
        <p>So there you have it. Follow these tips, figure out your own and focus on developing the work ethic. Work is Worship. I truly believe that salvation from this ridiculously flawed brain is to work super hard to be rid of imperfections and be one with the flow. Too deep?</p>
        <p>Take care. Lusid.</p>

        <h1>Should you still do remote freelance WordPress development? Here’s a look at the stats.</h1>
        <p>Did you know that a client looking for a custom WordPress site usually pays between $3,000 and $15,000 dollars to a remote freelancer, according to ManageWP.com?</p>
        <p>In this post, I’ll show you the stats that point to an abundance of remote freelance work in the WordPress market and where to find a good client for your next project.</p>
        <h2>The WordPress world, a 2-sided market.</h2>
        <p>WordPress is a beast that powers 29% of the Internet, and there are over 74.6 million websites that depend on it. Self-hosted WordPress websites account for 20% of that and over 50,000 WordPress websites are launched daily. That means there’s a monstrous market and a lot of work that needs to be done. This market can be put into 2 broad categories: WordPress users and developers.</p>
        <p>The WordPress ecosystem keeps growing because these 2 worlds need each other. It’s the good ol’ supply and demand rule.</p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>1st group: WordPress users (Business Owners)</h2>
        <p>The first category is users and business owners. They either have little to no technical knowledge, or they’re too busy running their business to spend time on the tech.</p>
        <p>WordPress powers a lot of different types of websites, including e-Commerce and exclusive membership websites. Some of these websites are served fine by using ready-made WordPress themes, but most of the time, a WordPress user needs to go a step further and add custom functionality specific to their business to the website.</p>
        <h2>2nd group: You (Developers)</h2>
        <p>The second group is you, developers. You’ve spent the thousands of hours learning coding and WordPress development.You know the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP necessary to make things work.</p>
        <p>Developers drive the technical side of the WordPress world with themes, plugins, custom websites, bug fixes, and updates.</p>
        <p>The business owners create the demand and you supply what you’re good at: development.</p>

        <p>If you jump into the freelance WordPress development market as a developer what’s your earning potential?</p>
        <h2>How much can I make as a remote freelance WordPress developer?</h2>
        <p>Here are the stats on the current state of the WordPress job and freelancing market.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>$50 per hour is the median hourly rate according to a study conducted in by WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg.</li>
            <li>The most successful Envato Power Elite author has sold over 100,000 copies of one theme alone.</li> 
            <li>A full site WordPress design can cost between $3,000 and $15,000 according to ManageWP.com.</li>
            <li>However, custom-built WordPress websites can go up to $100,000, according to PostStatus.</li>
            <li>25% of all WordPress themes on ThemeForest have made at least $2,500 in a month, according to Envato.</li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        <h2>Where can I find these remote freelance WordPress jobs?</h2>
        <p>The good clients avoid websites like UpWork, Freelancer, and Fiverr like the plague. They know it always dissolves into a bidding war with inexperienced overseas developers. That’s never fun for both the client and developer. As a remote freelancer, you want to avoid the low-ball clients that tend to flock to places like UpWork.</p>
        <p>I’ve been lucky enough to not have to use these websites because I know where to find good clients and you don’t have to put up with it anymore either.</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>How to find good clients</h2>
        <p>So where do you find the good clients? They post all over the internet in various communities, job boards, and forums. Clients post their job on job boards like WordPress Jobs and Angel List. When it comes to freelance projects they post on Reddit, comment on a thread in Hacker News, and post on a variety of other places like Twitter and Facebook Groups. It can be overwhelming and take hours a week if you don’t know where to look, but the good ones are definitely out there posting and looking for talent.</p>

        <h1>15 Interesting Facts You Might Not Know About the Moon</h1>
        <p>We see it every night, and without it, things would be very different here on Earth. Here’s some facts you might have missed about that big rock over our heads — the Moon.</p>
        <h2>Moon Facts</h2>
        <p>#1 — There is no dark side of the Moon. The belief that there is a permanent dark side probably comes about because only one side of the Moon is ever seen from Earth, but both sides of the Moon actually see the same amount of sunlight. The moon rotates on its own axis the same amount of time it takes it to go around the Earth. The only time humans have seen the other side was from orbiting spacecraft around the Moon. At one period in time, the Moon rotated at a different speed, but the pull from the Earth caused the Moon’s mass to shift toward the Earth. This essentially locked it into a perfect rotation with us here on Earth. Interestingly, other planet’s moons in our solar system have done the same thing.</p>
        <p>#2 — The moon is slowly moving away from Earth. It moves about 3.8 cm every year, and in 50 billion years it will take the moon about 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of its current 27.3 days.</p>
        <p>#3 — Currently the most widely held theory on how the Moon was made is that an object the size of Mars smashed into Earth. The collision caused a mass of debris to orbit the Earth, and these pieces slowly began to gather together over a long period of time. This collection of rock and particles is what eventually formed the Moon we see today.</p>
        <p>#4 — The Moon isn’t exactly round as it appears, it’s actually shaped like an egg. The Moon has its center of mass about 1.2 miles away from its geometrical center which gives it, albeit an indiscernible, egg shape.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news6-1.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>#5 — Tides on Earth happen because of the gravitational pull of the Moon. When one side of Earth is facing the Moon, the oceans are pulled on both sides of the planet. A bulge (high tide) happens because the Moon is pulling water toward it, and on the opposite side of the planet, the bulge (also high-tide) happens because the Moon is “pulling” the Earth away from the water. Of course low-tide occurs on the other two sides. You can always know if it is high tide when the Moon is directly overhead, or you know it’s on the opposite side of the planet.</p>
        <p>#6 — There are small moonquakes on the Moon. Astronauts discovered this using seismographs during their missions there. They are believed to occur a few miles under the surface and result in cracks in the surface. This has led scientists to theorize that the moon has a molten center similar to the one here on Earth.</p>
        <p>#7 — The Russians were actually the first to get close to the Moon. They sent Luna 1 toward it in 1959, and the craft came within 3,725 miles of the Moon. Luna 1 was supposed to impact the Moon, but a malfunction caused it to fly by. It may seem like a large distance, but given the distance from the Earth to the Moon is 251,970 miles at its farthest point, it’s pretty darn close. Things went better for the Russians in the same year when they impacted Luna 2 on the Moon’s surface. The U.S. put its first craft, Ranger 4, on the Moon in 1962 when it crashed intentionally into the surface. In 1966, the Soviets returned once again and were the first to actually land a spacecraft safely (and softly) on the Moon with Luna 9.</p>
        <p>#8 — Apollo 14 Astronaut, Stuart Roosa, took some seeds with him while in orbit around the Moon during the time Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell were on the surface. The seeds were later germinated when they got back to Earth and more than 400 were planted at different places in the country as well as around the world. They came to be known as “Moon Trees” and are still alive and well today.</p>
        <p>#9 — There was a plan in the late 1950’s that was developed by the U.S. Air Force to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon. The top-secret project called Project A119, ‘A Study of Lunar Research Flights’, was to demonstrate the military capability of the U.S. at the height of the Cold War by exploding a nuclear warhead somewhere on the surface of the Moon.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news6-2.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>#10 — There is a 2-foot wide panel with 100 mirrors sitting on the Moon’s surface pointing at Earth. It’s used to accurately measure the distance from the Earth to the Moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin placed it on July 21, 1969 just before the end of their final moonwalk. It’s the only science experiment from the Apollo missions that continues to run to this day. Telescopes here on Earth send laser pulses off the mirrors on the Moon and intercept the returning pulse to get the distance measurement.</p>
        <p>#11 — NASA has discovered water in the form of ice on the moon. After the LCROSS probe impacted the lunar south pole of the moon in 2009, scientists found the equivalent of around twenty-four gallons of water in the crater where the probe impacted. They believed water was present there since the permanently shadowed craters could keep water frozen at the surface.</p>
        <p>#12 — The Moon has extreme temperature variations because of its lack of atmosphere. It can get as hot as 260 degrees Fahrenheit and as cold as minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>#13 — The Apollo missions brought back 842 pounds of lunar rock and soil from the Moon while Soviet spacecraft returned about three-quarters of a pound of material.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news6-3.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>#14 — There is definitely a lot of trash left on the Moon from all those space missions. In all, there is about 400,000 pounds of man-made material sitting on the lunar surface. Some things that have been left behind: 70 different spacecraft, which includes crashed orbiters and rovers, 96 bags of human waste in one form or another, 2 golf balls, TV cameras, 12 pairs of boots, and many other pieces of equipment. Someone on the moon cleaning crew is going to have to do a lot of work.</p>

        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>#15 — 12 people have set foot on the Moon. We all know who the first was, but the last man to do it was Gene Cernan on Apollo 17 in 1972. No human has been back since. Buzz Aldrin was the first person to urinate on the Moon. Okay, it was in his spacesuit, which had the necessary equipment for such a thing, but somebody had to take that historic leap.</p>

        <h1>The Deepest Hole in the World</h1>
        <p>For 24 years, Soviet scientists dug deeper into the Earth’s surface than anyone had ever done before. The result was the Kola Superdeep Borehole located on the Kola Peninsula in Russia.</p>
        <p>The ambitious project began in the 1970s, and scientists in the former Soviet Union began to drill a hole that was just 9-inches in diameter. The hole eventually extended 7.5 miles into the Earth’s crust, farther than the deepest point in the ocean, Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean at 6.8 miles.</p>
        <p>What did the scientists learn, and what did they find at these incredible depths? Quite a lot actually. They found single-celled plankton organisms at 4.3 miles down, and at nearly the same depth they discovered water. They also discovered that the temperature reached 356° F at the bottom of the hole which was more than their estimates. This became the reason the hole had to be eventually abandoned in 1994. The hole was simply too hot for drilling to continue. The environment became more liquid because of the hot conditions, and the borehole was increasingly more difficult to maintain. Plus it ruined equipment quickly.</p>
        <p>But the scientists were able to more accurately estimate the distance to the center of the Earth to almost 4,000 miles. Their hole was only a drop in the bucket compared to the massive distance farther to the Earth’s center. The hole barely made it into the Earth’s crust, which is about 23 miles thick. The goal had been to extend into the Earth’s mantle, which is approximately 1,800 miles thick under the crust.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news7-1.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption>The borehole welded shut Rakot13/Wikimedia</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The first attempt at getting to the mantle took place in 1958 off the coast of Guadalupe, Mexico in the Pacific Ocean called Project Mohole. American engineers drilled in 11,700 feet of water and extended a hole 601 feet beneath the seafloor. They project ran out of funding in 1966. The next large attempt happened from 1987 to 1995 where the German Continental Deep Drilling Program was begun by German scientists in Bavaria. They managed to get about 5.7 miles down and discovered temperatures that got as high as 600° F. They too ran out funding.</p>
        <p>Since the Earth’s crust is thinner under the ocean floor, that is where the next attempt at going deeper is set to take place. The Chikyu, a specialized Japanese drill ship, has the record for the deepest offshore hole used for scientific purposes at almost 2 miles beneath the sea floor. An international team that is using the Chikyu is now attempting to go deeper. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program was begun in 2003 and is trying to get to the Earth’s mantle, where temperatures can start at 1,600° F. The program will take many years, and it’s cost may reach $1 billion.</p>

        <h1>Strange and Fascinating Nautical Superstitions</h1>
        <p>Life at sea was hard enough for sailors and fishermen hundreds of years ago. They had the danger of being on the open water, the weather, and the endless work to complete, but one thing they also had to contend with was remembering the long list of superstitions they had to follow.</p>
        <h2>Unlucky Fridays</h2>
        <p>Fridays were once considered to be the unluckiest day of the week to start a voyage since Jesus Christ was crucified on a Friday. But Thursdays are also considered unlucky because it’s considered the day of Thor, the god of storms and thunder. Count out the first Monday in April too, as this was the day that Cain killed Abel, and the second Monday in August is off limits because it was the day Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.</p>

        <h2>No Bananas</h2>
        <p>Bananas have been thought to bring bad luck on ships for a long time, and there are many theories on why such a lovable fruit could be considered so bad. Bananas spoiled rather quickly, especially when they were in a warm cargo hold, and they would release deadly fumes as they fermented. Another theory suggests that when bananas were aboard a ship, fishermen weren’t able to catch any fish because of how quickly they had to get the bananas to their destination before they went bad. In addition to bananas going bad, sometimes poisonous spiders would be packed away with the fruit. A sailor would get bit by a spider and die, thus the association with bananas and death was formed. These are just a few of the, “no bananas on board” theories.</p>

        <h2>Sorry, No Women on Board Either</h2>
        <p>Women were considered a distraction to sailors from completing their duties or thought of as a source of jealousy between sailors. This would make the sea angry. Mermaids, the half-woman, half-fish creatures, were also believed to lure a ship with their siren song into treacherous waters where the ship would be destroyed. This didn’t stop sailors from putting women on the figureheads of ships, however. The often bare-breasted women were thought to calm the sea, and her open eyes would guide the ship to safety.</p>

        <h2>Whistling and the Weather</h2>
        <p>Whistling on a ship was considered a no-no. It was believed that whistling would bring up a storm. While this has no basis in fact, the saying, “Red sky in the morning, sailor take warning. Red sky at night, sailor’s delight,” does have some merit. If the skies are red in the morning, it’s because the sun in the east illuminates the bottom of moisture-laden clouds in the west if more clouds are rolling in. If skies are red at sunset, sunlight is clear from the west so the westerly wind will be bringing clear skies. The saying works best at the mid-latitudes where the prevailing winds travel west to east.</p>

        <h2>Don’t Change the Name of a Ship</h2>
        <p>It’s considered bad luck to change the name of a ship after it has been christened. Now if the name of the ship just had to be changed, there were some procedures that had to take place. First, the old name had to be removed from the ship, even from the logbooks. Next the old name had to be written on a piece of paper, placed in a box, and then burned until there were only ashes left. The remains of the box were then thrown into the sea when there was an outgoing tide.</p>
        <p>Another interesting ceremony takes place when a mast is about to be stepped, which is when a boat’s mast is set into a notch in the keel. A coin is placed under the mast before it is set. This tradition is said to go back to the ancient Romans when they placed coins in the mouths of men when they were killed in battle. The reason for the coin under the mast was so the crew of the ship would be able to pay Charon, the ferryman of Hades, to cross the River Styx in the afterlife. The placing of a coin or some other memorabilia to bring good luck under a mast is done even today on modern ships.</p>

        <h2>Dolphins and Sharks</h2>
        <p>The sign of a shark following a ship told of an imminent death aboard the ship, while dolphins were considered good luck and and a harbinger of good things to come.</p>
        <p>There were other animals that were considered good and bad luck to mariners too. Turtles were considered good luck, and sailors that carried their bones were supposed to have good fortune. But if a sailor killed a turtle and didn’t eat it, they would have bad luck. Sailors also had a fear of manta rays because these animals were believed to be able to attach themselves to a ship’s anchor and drag it under the sea. Killing a seabird such as a seagull or an albatross, as well as a dolphin, was thought to bring bad luck. Seabirds were thought to carry the souls of dead sailors.</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>Sailing Cats</h2>
        <p>A cat on board a ship was considered lucky, even a black cat. Cats had a practical reason for being on board a ship since they caught rats that could spread disease, damage ropes, or eat grain. They were thought to have powers that protected ships from dangerous weather, but it was also believed that the animals could summon a storm with magic that was stored in their tails.</p>
        <h2>Forbidden Words</h2>
        <p>It was considered bad luck to say certain words aboard a ship. Saying the words “drown”, “pig”, “goodbye”, and “good luck” were strictly off limits. It was also considered bad luck for the wives of the men going to sea to tell them goodbye or wave goodbye once they left for their voyage.</p>

        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Avoid these People</h2>
        <p>It was considered bad luck to run into a redhead before a ship began its voyage. The crisis could be averted, however, if the sailor spoke to the redhead first. Priests were also considered bad luck on a voyage since they dressed in black and performed funeral services. In addition, flat-footed people were avoided and were considered bad luck on board a ship for some reason.</p>
        <h2>Other Superstitions</h2>
        <p>In addition to the superstitions mentioned above, sailors also had to avoid these other things that could get them in trouble. A sailor had to remember to step aboard a ship with their left foot first, and if they saw rats leaving the ship that was a sign of impending disaster on their voyage. Sailors weren’t supposed to trim their nails, shave, or cut their hair since it was believed to bring bad luck to the ship, and finally, fishermen salted their nets before the beginning of each season to bring them good luck.</p>

        <h1>Why I travel solo</h1>
        <p>I’m 27 and female. Since I was 21, I’ve been away at least once a year, for anything from 3 nights to 9 months, alone. I also go on trips with friends, but I make a point of regularly going solo.</p>
        <p>When alone, I’ve been met with various reactions, but they tend to fall into two broad camps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Awesome, that must be really fun! (Wide eyes, look of interest, wants to hear stories)</li>
            <li>Really? You’re on your own?! Why?? (Raised eyebrows, expression of slight distrust, thinks I’m weird)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Both are totally valid. In fact, depending on what’s happened that day, either can feel completely (sometimes painfully) justified.</p>
        <p>It’s rare that I forge a friendship with someone from the second camp. And, if they get me on a bad day, their reaction can feel like a gentle kick in the stomach.</p>
        <p>As I look to the year ahead, and think about the trips I’ll inevitably make alone, I’m offering myself a small reminder of why it’s necessary and important to me. Just in case I need a little push.</p>
        <p>But more than that: I’d like to share my reasons for travelling solo with those who might fall somewhere in the region of camp number 2 — and hopefully do it a little more coherently than I would if I were standing in a hostel kitchen with my hand in a jar of shop-bought pasta sauce.</p>
        <h4>So, here they are: the seven reasons I travel solo.</h4>
        <h2>1. Because I can do things my way</h2>
        <p>I can wander off. Stay. Go. Change my mind. Follow a whim. I don’t have anyone else’s preferences, needs or feelings to bear in mind and carefully balance against my own. I can be utterly selfish and not feel bad about it. For most human adults — typically surrounded by and attuned to the needs of children, parents, friends, colleagues, clients, pets — this is a strange and wonderful luxury.</p>
        <h2>2. Because I can see what ‘me’ really looks like</h2>
        <p>With no one around who knows me, I’m in my own little social vacuum. Stripping out the group norms of my social circles — those silent rules of engagement, shared experiences and in-jokes that quietly guide our day-to-day interactions — leaves nothing left except… me. Sometimes I like what I see there, sometimes I question it, and sometimes it comes as a surprise. Either way, exposure feels interesting and important.</p>
        <h2>3. Because new friends are everywhere</h2>
        <p>It’s seriously noticeable how much more readily people will approach someone who’s sitting alone and strike up conversation. I’ve chewed coca leaves with a Peruvian social activist, played guitar with a Chilean musician, shared my journal with a Chinese mother-of-two, and been taught to surf by an Australian farmhand. I don’t believe any of those moments would have happened — or certainly felt like such rich, colourful moments of connection— if I hadn’t been sitting by myself.</p>
        <h2>4. Because it shines a light on the kindness of strangers</h2>
        <p>I’ve learned that the quickest way to see the best of humanity is to make yourself vulnerable. I’ve found myself in hot (make that cold) water more times than I’d like, and every time been rescued by a warm-hearted and generous stranger. Regular reminders of why I should have faith in humanity sure is good for the soul.</p>
        <h2>5. Because it keeps me present</h2>
        <p>Other people are distracting. That can be awesome, and being connected with another person is one of the great joys of life. But walking up hills, through city streets, and along beaches with no conversation to be had other than the quiet mutterings and observations that happen inside my head gives me the headspace to take more in. Colours seems brighter, sounds louder. I’m more aware of what’s around me.</p>
        <h2>6. Because it’s scary</h2>
        <p>Some days, anyway. I’m not always as gung ho as I could be. I’m easily scared when lost (which happens a lot), and not being able to communicate in the local language can make me feel painfully vulnerable. But — and I’m desperately trying to find a way to say this without resorting to tired cliché— my comfort zone doesn’t feel very good if I stay there too long. Being in scenarios that send me marching (or reluctantly crawling) into vulnerability, uncertainty and discomfort is utterly crucial to my wellbeing. It’s what brings me to life, and keeps me there.</p>
        <h2>7. Because it reminds me that I can</h2>
        <p>The knowledge that I need no-one other than myself is the source of my deepest inner reserves. Other people — those who help in a crisis, or become road trip buddies, or share small moments with me around bowls of coca leaves — become a wonderful added bonus that I feel real, conscious gratitude for. But strengthening the quiet voice that says ‘I’ll be OK’ is an important gift to keep giving myself, for as long as I still need to be reminded.</p>
        <p>There will always be moments of discomfort: when I have to take a selfie (I still cringe) because there’s no one else there to take a picture of me atop some famous waterfall; when I’m lost, skint or otherwise up shit-creek and wish I had someone to laugh instead of cry with; or when I’m having a down-day and there’s no one around who knows me. But the difficult moments are what make the reasons above all the more important and true for me. And it is these seven reasons which have propelled me towards the intense, grounding, connected experiences that sit like bright beautiful splashes of colour on the weird patchwork that is my twenties-so-far.</p>
        <p>So. If you’ve ever found yourself in the second camp — looking at this slightly bedraggled solo-traveller as she makes herself some sad looking pasta-for-one, and thinking she might be a bit odd — well, I hope this explains it a little. Let’s have a beer.</p>

        <h1>16 Apps That Will Help You Travel The World</h1>
        <p>If you ask just about anyone what they’d like to do more of, travel is bound to be one of the most common answers. For those of us who don’t travel a ton, we want to see new and exciting destinations—and we want to do it more frequently. For those of us who travel a lot (especially for work), we want to find ways to make the experience as efficient and authentic as possible.</p>
        <p>The Product Hunt community loves to travel, and it’s clear just from the sheer number of adventure-related apps and products; there are close to 200 tagged in the “Travel” category. Here are 16 of the best, built to help you make the most of your upcoming trips, whether for business or pleasure (or both).</p>
        <h2>1. Destinations on Google</h2>
        <p>Explore cities and book flights with Google.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-1.jpeg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Google keeps getting smarter. Now, when you’re planning a trip on your mobile device, type in the continent, country, or state you’d like to visit and add the word “destination” to get an automatic collection of options. Google will suggest spots that fit with your hobbies and interests, as well as refine travel options to avoid crowds or bad weather. You can book your flights, hotels, and itineraries directly from Google as well. Travel life just got so much easier.</p>
        <h2>2. Quest Organizer</h2>
        <p>Spend less on your next travel quest.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-2.png' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>It can sometimes be a pain to book a trip when you want to visit multiple cities in between your first and last stop. QuestOrganizer makes the multi-destination trip easier to plan by helping you find free stopovers, build a custom flight using a number of one-way flights, and hack your trip to find the cheapest total rate possible. We love the simplicity of this app.</p>
        <h2>3. Tripnary</h2>
        <p>Find great places to fly on your budget.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-3.png' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This one is super simple and fun to use. The search is based primarily on what you’re looking to do (e.g. beach vacation, winter getaway, local partying), as well as the price you’re looking to spend on the trip. If you plan far enough ahead, you’ll get a notification every time your ideal itinerary lowers in price. This is an especially useful app for those who are budget conscious and have flexible travel dates.</p>
        <h2>4. Travo</h2>
        <p>Smart trip planning for the “mission critical” traveler.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-4.png' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Travo was built to help you save time and energy planning any travel you do specifically for meetings and events. Unlike many other sites that focus on price, this app helps you get to your destination at a specific time (and also at the most efficient price). This is a must-use app for business travelers who have tight schedules and don’t want to worry about the hassle of planning down to the minute.</p>
        <h2>5. Nomad List Collections</h2>
        <p>Curated collections of the best places to live and travel.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-5.png' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Nomad List is a phenomenal resource for those who travel frequently for both work and play. The collections are curated to help you find interesting places to visit based on categories like: visa-free destinations for American citizens, best cities to live in Asia, safest cities for solo female travelers, and best cities to bootstrap a startup. This is one of those sites you’ll want to bookmark and come back to over and over again.</p>
        <h2>6. Tripomatic 3.0</h2>
        <p>Itinerary planner for independent travelers.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-6.png' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Have you ever wondered, upon landing in a new city, exactly what you should do? You might want to be a bit spontaneous, but you also don’t want to miss any of the must-see spots. Enter: Tripomatic. Search your destination, and up pops a list of top destinations for sightseeing, food, drink, and more. This is a great guide if you want a little bit of itinerary help without needing to lug a big Lonely Planet book around with you.</p>
        <h2>7. Airbnb Live There</h2>
        <p>Don’t go there. Live there.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-7.gif' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We’re already obsessed with Airbnb. But now, the company is offering a host of features that enable you to truly live like a local wherever you travel. The newly designed app is built to match you to the homes, neighborhoods, and experiences that will help you explore a city the way it’s meant to be lived in. You can find spots closer to the things you want to do, or you can search by property (e.g. apartment, bungalow, castle) and neighborhood type (e.g. quiet, hip, scenic). Airbnb’s Guidebooks are another fun addition, complete with millions of host tips‚ from the best bars and restaurants to off-the-beaten-path gems. It’s never been easier to experience a city like a local, no matter how long you’re in town.</p>
        <h2>8. Grabr</h2>
        <p>Peer-to-peer international shopping & delivery.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-8.gif' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you’re going to be traveling, you might as well make some money, right? Grabr is a peer-to-peer delivery service that matches locals who want to purchase something in a different city with travelers visiting from those cities. If you’re headed to Japan from NYC, you might find someone already in Japan who wants a pair of sneakers from a shop in NYC. If you win the gig, you grab what the “shopper” is looking for, and then get paid to deliver them when you get into town. If Postmates and Party With a Local had a travel app baby, this would be it.</p>
        <h2>9. Boom</h2>
        <p>This supersonic passenger jet gets you from NYC to LDN in 3½ hours.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-9.png' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Before you get too excited, these planes don’t actually exist yet. But when they do, 
        their goal is to go 2.2x the speed of sound (!!!). If that actually happens, passengers will be able to get people from NYC to London in 3.5 hours, and SF to Tokyo in just 4.5 hours. The company is still working on its first prototype and hopes to give it a test drive at some point next year. Even Virgin Group is thrilled about the idea: they recently signed a letter of intent for 10 planes, valued at around $2 billion. Richard Branson does have a knack for turning just about anything he touches into gold, so we’re feeling optimistic about Boom.</p>
        <h2>10. Overnight</h2>
        <p>Book a last-minute stay with local hosts.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-10.jpeg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This app is built specifically around last-minute trips. It functions similarly to Airbnb, but focuses more on day-of travel. You look for a location where you’d like to spend the night, and hosts get to decide if they want to host you that day. This is a great way to find a place to stay without much planning needed; just go on your adventure, and let the serendipity begin!</p>
        <h2>11. Plane</h2>
        <p>Connect with new people in new places.</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news10-11.png' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This social icebreaker app helps you connect with new people in new places. You ask a question, and other app users will answer if it’s relevant to them. For example, you can use Plane to find people who are going out to good restaurants, bars, and concerts you want to check out while in town. This is a great tool for those who want to connect with and meet locals while having a new experience. Poof! There goes the need to use Tinder to make friends while you’re traveling.</p>

        <p>There is plenty of interest between the two biggest cities in Portugal. Heading south from Porto, the first notable location is Aveiro, a small and friendly city with a network of canals. Next, Coimbra is simply magnificent: the heart of Portuguese academia, with a university installed in a hilltop palace. The highlight is the Biblioteca Joanina – an outstanding Baroque library.</p>

        <p>In March 2019, the island of Zlarin made a pledge to be Croatia's first island to scrap single-use plastics. Starting this Spring, environmental activists as well as local residents on the island are working towards the goal to eliminate the use of bags, plates, cutlery and glasses made of plastic and replace these with more sustainable alternatives.</p>
        <p>Connected by ferry to the charming city of Šibenik, this small island covers an area of only eight square kilometres, but there are 19 kilometres of coastline which means plenty of beaches. There's another excellent reason to visit: Zlarin is also car-free! Hire a bicycle and you're all set for a low-carbon island holiday.</p>

        <p>“Honest and natural winemaking” is the ethos of Roxanich, winemakers producing quality vintages in the vineyard-covered hills of Istria, Croatia's westernmost region. Inspired by biodynamic agriculture – an organic approach to farming developed by Rudolf Steiner and guided by principles like balance and sustainability, chemicals are avoided as much as possible in the wine-making process in favour of natural ingredients.</p>
        <p>The much anticipated Roxanich Wine & Heritage Hotel opened its doors in April at the foot of the charming hilltop village of Motovun, and is a fine addition to Istria's gastronomic map. Tours of the massive wine cellars, wine-tasting experiences, and tasting menus combined with wine pairing are on offer here along with stylish guest rooms and a wellness centre if you're looking for a gastronomic escape.</p>
        <h2>Learn about eco-friendly building techniques</h2>
        <p>If you're intrigued by eco-friendly buildings and would like to go hands-on and learn a few techniques in green building, Gea Via is the place for you. This eco-retreat camp on the island of Brač is holding a workshop in dry-stone walling where participants can learn how to build the dry-stone walls so typical in rural parts of Croatia made without the use of mortar or other materials. Another week-long workshop on 'Creating your eco-building' tackles simple construction techniques using renewable or recycled materials.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of examples of sustainable buildings at Gea Via to be inspired by: check out the straw bale eco-cabin, large dome tent for seminars and yoga retreats, outdoor kitchen, the stone circle open-air auditorium, and reed-roofed huts. Set in an olive grove overlooking the sea, accommodation is provided in glamping huts and tents.</p>

        <p>Vis has been in the international spotlight in the past year as the picturesque filming location for Mamma Mia 2. But this Dalmatian island was in the news again last month when it was designated as a UNESCO Global Geopark. This status recognises its exceptional geological heritage. Vis and the nearby islands of Jabuka, Brusnik, Biševo and Palagruža, which make up the Vis archipelago, are geologically the oldest islands of the Adriatic Sea.</p>
        <p>The best-known attraction here is the Blue Cave: a sea cave only accessible by boat located in a small bay on the island of Biševo. Visit around midday to see the cave fill with a magical glowing blue light reflecting off the limestone walls.</p>

        <p>The festival season is finally upon us and we’re bursting with excitement. Glastonbury, Coachella, Primavera, you name it – we’ll be there. However, we can’t help but be acutely aware that festivals produce a shocking amount of plastic. The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) say that audiences at UK festivals consume 10 million plastic bottles and that 250,000 tents are left at festival sites annually.</p>
        <p>But we’re determined not to let the doom and gloom taint our festival experiences, or yours! Instead, we’ve come up with an festival guide for the ecologically minded, so you can have an unforgettable festival experience and feel safe in the knowledge that you’re doing your bit for the planet simultaneously. Roll on our 5 suggestions for a greener festival season.</p>
        <h2>Pack an eco-friendly ‘festival survival & hygiene kit’</h2>
        <figure>

        <figcaption>Deodorant from the survival kitFull Circle</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Packing for a festival with limited space in your bag can often lead you to buying multiple small plastic bottles that will be chucked away after a fun-filled weekend. Thankfully, Full Circle has got your hygiene needs covered this festival season. Within this nifty kit, you will find 9 products - all of which are either reusable, biodegradable or recyclable.</p>
        <p>What’s included: antiperspirant in a recyclable aluminium can, toothpaste in a zero-waste reusable aluminium pot, a biodegradable eco-towel, dry shampoo in a recyclable aluminium can, 100% recycled toilet paper, anti-bac in a reusable aluminium bottle, biodegradable face-wipes and no-rinse body wash in a zero-waste reusable aluminium bottle. What more could you need? Priced at £22.99.</p>
        <h2>Sparkle in sustainable style</h2>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news13-3.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption>Biodegradable glitterEcoStardust</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Glitter may look pretty but what it can do to the planet is ugly, as micro-plastics seep into our oceans and work their way up to the top of the food chain. 38 Degrees began a petition to ban micro-plastic glitter as they found in a recent study that ‘up to a third of fish caught in the North Sea contained micro-plastic particles’.</p>
        <p>Enter EcoStardust Glitter made from a ‘special biodegradable film’ created from plant cellulose sourced principally from sustainably-farmed eucalyptus trees. This glitter not only looks dazzling but is safe for your skin, hair and the environment. The bio-glitter comes in aluminium tins or biodegradable grip seal bags and can be popped into recycling once you’ve sparkled your way through the festival season.</p>
        <h2>Take a reusable bottle</h2>
        <p>Greenpeace has now estimated that 12.7 million tonnes of plastic find their way into our oceans each year. That’s a shocking statistic but we can reduce that significantly, by opting for a reusable bottle rather than a plastic one. We think S’well Water Bottles are a perfect replacement as they’re designed to keep your drink cold for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>From £24.49 and available on Zen Wardrobe</p>
        <h2>A Tent is for life, not just for a festival</h2>

        <figcaption>Biodegradable glitterEcoStardust</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The AIF found that 875 tonnes in plastic waste had been left in the form of tents after the UK festival season in 2018 - which is equivalent to eight blue whales! So what options do we have to dramatically decrease this shocking statistic?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure you buy a tent that will last and take it home with you</li>
            <li>Rent a tent via Fat Llama if you don’t want to invest in a tent for life - it’s like Airbnb for useful items</li>
            <li>Glampify your festival experience by investing in a 100% cotton and biodegradable bell tent available on CanvasCamp</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A £100m fund has been established to help UK firms capitalise on the boom in offshore wind.</p>
        <p>With the UK so well suited to exploiting wind power, turbines have been erected in more than 30 locations from Brighton to the Moray Firth.</p>
        <p>But trade unions say the boom has not generated enough jobs for UK workers.</p>
        <p>The Offshore Wind Industry Council says its initiative will help hundreds of firms "maximise opportunities" in the offshore wind supply chain.</p>
        <p>"The Offshore Wind Growth Partnership will provide practical help for UK companies so they can compete successfully for contracts in this thriving global market," said Benj Sykes, chairman of the OWIC and UK country manager for the Danish firm Orsted.</p>
        <p>The OWIC, which is a joint government and industry body, will invest the privately-raised funds over 10 years to support companies in the supply chain.</p>
        <p>Firms that manufacture parts, lay cables and maintain wind farms will receive support ranging from "expert advice on manufacturing and commercialisation" to funding for innovation. They will also be given support to export their products and services.</p>
        <p>By 2030 the offshore wind power market is expected to be worth £30bn per year, with the UK expected to be generating a third of its electricity from wind. The OWIC hopes to raise the participation of UK businesses in the industry from 48% currently to 60%, under a sector deal agreed between industry and government.</p>
        <p>The new fund will bring "investment, thousands of high-quality jobs and huge economic opportunities for communities across the UK", energy and clean growth minister Chris Skidmore said.</p>
        <p>Last month GMB general secretary, Tim Roache said Britain's politicians needed "to sharpen their elbows in the fight for jobs" when it came to opportunities in the growing renewables sector.</p>
        <p>The union says up to 1,000 jobs could be created at two mothballed yards in Fife if EDF chose local firms to manufacture parts for a huge wind farm project there, rather than as is expected the work being done in Indonesia, Belgium and Spain.</p>

        <p>Lloyds Banking Group has refused to reveal how much money is in the Jersey accounts which it has frozen amid heightened fears about financial crime.</p>
        <p>It would not say how many of the 8,000 accounts were held by UK citizens.</p>
        <p>Lloyds said the accounts were suspended because customers failed to respond to requests to prove their identity.</p>
        <p>The crackdown came after the imposition of tougher money laundering rules in Jersey, which has faced pressure to improve its financial transparency.</p>
        <p>The drastic action to freeze accounts was revealed in the Financial Times. The paper said that HSBC, Barclays and RBS had also tightened controls in Jersey.</p>
        <p>Lloyds emphasised that it had frozen the accounts because customers had not got back in touch, not because of any other specific concerns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Islands' secret records to be made public</li>
            <li>Jersey is 'seventh worst tax haven'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lloyds started trying to contact expatriate customers of its Jersey operation in January 2016, asking them to update their details and provide missing information.</p>
        <p>A crucial component of the information required is a certified identity document, proving that the account holder is genuine.</p>
        <p>"Unfortunately, where a customer has not provided us with this necessary information we have had to freeze their account until we get the information," said a spokesperson for Lloyds.</p>
        <p>"This is also to protect the customer, as it prevents anybody else trying to use the account if the customer has stopped using it or has moved address."</p>
        <p>Accounts in the Channel Islands and other offshore centres are commonly used by overseas workers to house money they have earned or saved in different currencies.</p>
        <p>But they attract suspicion about tax avoidance, and fears that they are used to stash illegal money from around the world.</p>

        <p>Scientists from round the world are meeting in Germany to improve ways of making money from carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>They don’t claim the technology will solve climate change, but they say it will help.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is already being used in novel ways to create fuels, polymers, fertilisers, proteins, foams and building blocks.</p>
        <p>Until recently, it was assumed that energy-intensive firms burning gas to fuel their processes would need eventually to capture the resulting carbon emissions and bury them underground.</p>
        <p>This option is inefficient and costly, so the prospect of utilising some of the CO2 as a valuable raw material is exciting for business.</p>
        <p>Katy Armstrong, manager of the Carbon Utilisation Centre at Sheffield University, put it this way: “We need products for the way we live - and everything we do has an impact.</p>
        <p>“We need to manufacture our products without increasing CO2 emissions, and if we can use waste CO2 to help make them, so much the better.”</p>
        <p>Many of the young carbon usage firms are actually carbon-negative: that means they take in more CO2 than they put out.</p>
        <p>We visited three pioneering businesses in the UK which are already making money out of CO2.</p>
        <p>Here are their recipes for success (or at least, the ones they will share with us).</p>
        <h2>Three success stories</h2>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news16-2.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Recipe: Put cow dung and maize into a bio-digester, where bacteria break them down and produce biogas to heat our homes.</p>
        <p>Mix the left-over sludge with nutrient-rich wastes from the fertiliser industry, sewage plants, farms or the food industry.</p>
        <p>Pump in CO2, which helps the nutrients bind to the sludge.</p>
        <p>Product: High-grade fertiliser pellets that have soaked up more CO2 than they produced. The technology has already won export orders.</p>
        <p>CO2 to beer bubbles: Strutt and Parker Farms, Suffolk</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news16-3.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Recipe: Take horse muck and straw from Newmarket races. Put the smelly mess through a bio-digester (as above).</p>
        <p>Extract biogas and CO2. Using advanced membranes, separate out food grade CO2.</p>
        <p>Product: Clean CO2 that’s sold to a local brewery to put the fizz into lemonade and lager.</p>
        <p>CO2 to building blocks: Carbon 8 Aggregates, Leeds</p>
        <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news16-4.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Recipe: Take ash from the chimney of a waste incinerator plant.</p>
        <p>Mix in water and CO2 - then stand back… this procedure gets very hot.</p>
        <p>The CO2 is permanently captured within the waste ash to form artificial limestone for building blocks and other purposes.</p>
        <p>The process has the additional benefit of treating the ash that would otherwise be sent to landfill.</p>
        <p>Product: blocks that have locked up CO2, whilst also reducing the need for carbon-intensive cement. The technology is winning exports.</p>
        <p>These firms are pioneers in what’s known as the Circular Economy, in which wastes are turned into raw materials. The EU is trying to prompt all industry to adopt this principle.</p>
        <h2>How much CO2 can products absorb?</h2>
        <p>The big question is how much of the approximately 37 gigatonnes of CO2 emitted annually from our homes, cars, planes, offices and industries can be utilised by industry.</p>
        <p>One report projected that seven gigatonnes a year of CO2 could be locked up into new products.</p>
        <p>Katy Armstrong described this figure as hugely optimistic. But she said: “Every tonne that’s captured is a tonne that doesn't heat the atmosphere, so let’s hope the industry thrives.”</p>
