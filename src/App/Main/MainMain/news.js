    <p>The best things in life may be free, but that doesn't mean they won't take time, sweat, and perseverance to acquire.</p>
    <p>That's especially the case when it comes to learning important life skills.</p>
    <p>In an effort to ascertain which talents are worth the investment, one Quora reader posed the question: What are the hardest and most useful skills to learn?</p>
    <p>We've highlighted our favorite takeaways.</p>
    <h2>1. Time management</h2>
    <p>Effective time management is one of the most highly valued skills by employers. While there is no one right way, it's important to find a system that works for you and stick to it, Alina Grzegorzewska explains.</p>
    <p>"The hardest thing to learn for me was how to plan," she writes. "Not to execute what I have planned, but to make so epic a to-do list and to schedule it so thoroughly that I'm really capable of completing all the tasks on the scheduled date."</p>   
    <h2>2. Empathy</h2>    
    <p>"You can be the most disciplined, brilliant, and even wealthy individual in the world, but if you don't care for or empathize with other people, then you are basically nothing but a sociopath," writes Kamia Taylor.</p>    
    <p>Empathy, as business owner Jane Wurdwand explains, is a fundamental human ability that has too readily been forsworn by modern business.</p>   
    <p>"Empathy — the ability to feel what others feel — is what makes good sales and service people truly great. Empathy as in team spirit — esprit d'corps — motivates people to try harder. Empathy drives employees to push beyond their own apathy, to go bigger, because they feel something bigger than just a paycheck," she writes.</p>   
    <h2>3. Mastering your sleep</h2>    
    <p>There are so many prescribed sleep hacks out there it's often hard to keep track. But regardless of what you choose, establishing a ritual can help ensure you have restful nights.</p>
    <p>Numerous studies show that being consistent with your sleep schedule makes it easier to fall asleep and wake up, and it helps promote better sleep in general.</p>

    </figure>
    <h2>4. Positive self-talk</h2>
    <p>"Ultimately it doesn't matter what others think of you," writes Shobhit Singhal, "but what you think of yourself certainly does, and it takes time to build that level of confidence and ability to believe in yourself when nobody else does."</p>
    <p>On the other side of positive self-talk is negative self-talk, which Betsy Myers, founding director of The Center for Women and Business at Bentley University, believes can slowly chip away at your confidence.</p>
    <h2>5. Consistency</h2>
    <p>Whether you're trying a new exercise routine, studying for the LSATs, or working on an important project, Khaleel Syed writes that consistency is vital to maintaining any kind of success.</p>
    <p>People often stop working hard when they reach the top, he explains, but to maintain that top position, they have to work harder and be more consistent in their work.</p>
    <h2>6. Asking for help</h2>
    <p>"I once was told in a job interview, 'You can't have this job if you can't ask for help when you need it,'" Louise Christy writes. "Naturally, I said I could. Later, I found out that the previous person with that job had screwed up big-time because he was in over his head but couldn't admit it and didn't ask for help."</p>
    <p>She explains that knowing when you need help and then asking for it is surprisingly difficult to learn and do because no one wants to be perceived as weak or incompetent.</p>
    <p>But a recent study from the Harvard Business School suggests doing so makes you look more, not less, capable. According to the study authors, when you ask people for advice, you validate their intelligence or expertise, which makes you more likely to win them over.</p>
    <h2>7. Knowing when to shut up — and actually doing it</h2>
    <p>"You can't go around whining about every other thing that seems not-so-right to you in this world," writes Roshna Nazir. "Sometimes you just need to shut up."</p>
    <p>There are many instances when keeping to yourself is the best course. "When we are angry, upset, agitated, or vexed," writes Anwesha Jana, "we blurt out anything and everything that comes to our mind." And later, you tend to regret it.</p>
    <p>Keeping your mouth shut when you're agitated is one of the most valuable skills to learn, and of course, one of the most difficult.</p>

        <figcaption>The first step to listening: stop talking.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>8. Listening</h2>
    <p>Along with shutting up comes listening, says Richard Careaga.</p>
    <p>"Most of us in the workplace are so overwhelmed with things to do — instant messaging, phones ringing. I mean, our brain can only tolerate so much information before it snaps," Nicole Lipkin, author of " What Keeps Leaders Up At Night," previously told Business Insider.</p>
    <p>One tip for active listening is repeating back what you heard to the other person. "It makes things so much easier when everyone is on the same page," she said.</p>
    <h2>9. Minding your business</h2>
    <p>"It takes ages to learn and master this," writes Aarushi Ruddra.</p>
    <p>Sticking your nose into other people's work isn't helpful and wastes time and resources, she says. "You have no right to put forth your two or four cents, even if you are the last righteous person standing."</p>
    <h2>10. Mastering your thoughts</h2>
    <p>To do what you want to do and accomplish what you want to accomplish, you need to consciously direct your thinking, writes Mark Givert.</p>
    <p>"The challenge is that we are the product of our past experience and all of our thinking is the result of this," he says. "However, the past does not equal the future."</p>

    <h1>5 Lessons Most People Learn Way Too Late in Life</h1>
    <figure>
        <p><img src='/images/fullPageNews/news2-1.jpg' alt='not found'></img></p>
        <figcaption>The first step to listening: stop talking.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>"What are the lessons people most often learn too late in life?" 
    originally appeared on Quora--the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people 
    to learn from others and better understand the world.</p>
    <p>Answer by Alyssa Satara, co-founder at Refugee Code Academy, on Quora:</p>
    <h2>1. Perception is reality</h2>
    <p>It's true. The way you interpret and understand the world directly affects your 
    beliefs and the way you live your life. Perception creates bias as much as it creates 
    understanding. It creates fear as much as it creates curiosity.</p>
    <p>Do you want your reality to be narrow or vast?</p>
    <p>Will the bliss that ignorance provides be sufficient, or do you need more?</p>
    <p>The truth is most people want more. Even if it is on a subconscious level. 
    Humans tend to trail blaze. From cradle to the grave, our society emphasizes the 
    importance of education. Learning and discovering is what we do, but still it is 
    increasingly hard to understand what you don't understand.</p>
    <p>So how do you learn to know what you don't know? Start by asking yourself:
     What don't I know? What do you want to learn more about?</p>
     <p>Most importantly, understand that it's OK to be wrong. In error there is growth.</p>
     <h2>2. Everything is temporary</h2>
     <p>Your good times are temporary and your bad times are temporary. 
     So when you're up, enjoy it, bask in it, and be grateful for it. 
     And when you're down, know you will get through it. Know that it's not the end, 
     and that it's just a rough patch. Life is full of twists and turns, ups and downs, 
     and surprises.</p>
     <p>We forget that it's about the journey not the destination.</p>
     <p>There is a lesson in everything. I think it's hard for a lot of people--especially 
     young people--to appreciate life. Recognizing the full worth of your hardships and 
     your blunders is key to appreciating the journey. It's just as important to stay humble 
     and be grateful for the joys life brings you.</p>
     <p>Everything is temporary, so make the most out of all of it.</p>
    <h2>3. The importance of being present</h2>
    <p>"If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are 
    living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present." --Lao Tzu</p>
    <p>More often than not, we tend to worry about what's to come, or dwell on 
    something that's already happened. While it's crucial to care and consider your 
    future, be careful not to let it hinder your present. Moments turn into memories. 
    Enjoy the moment while you have it.</p>
    <p>It usually takes a lifetime of piled up worries for a person to realize: 
    Worrying isn't productive.</p>
    <p>Living in the past is equally unproductive. There are definitely benefits in 
    being able to reflect on yourself and on your past. Paying attention to what you've 
    been through and how that makes you feel matters. It takes a lot of emotional energy 
    to grieve, process, and overcome.</p>
    <p>The balance of being able to take time to reflect, and to prioritize your future 
    while spending the majority of your day in the present, is beyond valuable, it's life 
    changing.</p>
    <h2>4. Do what you love, love what you do</h2>
    <p>There was a huge mosaic near my university in London that said that those words. 
    I was grateful to walk past it almost every day and remind myself of the importance of 
    loving your career and loving what you do. Your work is a considerably large aspect in 
    your life that you dedicate yourself to. If you aren't happy in your career, that 
    unhappiness will seep into other aspects of your life. And while nothing is perfect, 
    it's important to work on yourself and position yourself to reach the goals and 
    satisfactions you desire.</p>
    <p>Most importantly: Invest in yourself.</p>
    <p>This goes for your non-work life, too. What habits and hobbies do you want to stop? 
    Which ones do you want to develop? It's important to be conscious of the type of people 
    and activities you surround yourself with. Information is like nutrients to your brain, 
    be aware of what you are feeding yourself. Success isn't one triumphant moment. Success 
    is a series of moments (and choices) leading up to bigger moments.</p>
    <p>You are the only person who can get in the way of living every day doing what you love.</p>
    <p>Bob Dylan said it best when he said "What's money? A man is a success if he gets 
    up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do."</p>
    <h2>5. Being happy takes work</h2>
    <p>The happiest people tend to be the ones who've worked the most on themselves. 
    Being happy takes a lot of work. It's just as much work--if not more-- to be unhappy. 
    So choose wisely. Being happy means at some point you decided to take control of your life.
     It means you decided to not be a victim and to put that energy back into yourself. 
     Sometimes it's hard, but you have to pull yourself up and push yourself forward.</p>
     <p>Your lifetime is a series of developments and personal growth.</p>
     <p>One of the worst things you can do for self-development is comparing yourself 
     to other people. It's easy to get caught up in jealousy and wanting what other people 
     have. Especially with the way we interact with social media. You have to remember that 
     people tend to show only the best parts of their lives on those platforms. It's not fair 
     to yourself when you see that and think "I want to do that" or "I want to look like that". 
     Not only does that distract you from being appreciative of what you have in our own life, 
     it doesn't provide any productive input to yourself. Most often, your perception of 
     someone's life is a fallacy. And even if it isn't, focus on yourself. It's your journey 
     and your path that you should be concerned with.</p>
     <p>Being happy takes practice. Whether it's you learning to 
     let go of your ego, or forming more self-loving habits...it takes practice. 
     You only have one life, work as hard as you can to make it your best life.</p>
